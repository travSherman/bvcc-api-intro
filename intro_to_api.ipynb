    "## What is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. It specifies how software components should interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are used to many **interfaces** in real life. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A door handle.** We don't care how a door works. All that we expect is that pushing or pulling the handle will open the door. In fact, the way the door opens (theoretically) could be entirely different each time we use the door. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **File->Print.** We don't care how the computer prints the document. All that we expect is that using the Print option in the File menu will print the document. In fact, the way the computer prints it could change every time the program is updated. \n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, we also use many interfaces. The interface we use to a programming library is its function calls. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Matplotlib `plot()`**: We don't care how the `plot()` function works. All that we expect is that calling this function (with appropriate parameters) will plot the data and return a graphic. In fact, how the function works can completely change from version to version. \n",
    "\n",
    "**These are APIs -- Application Programming Interfaces.** The functions that you call and the parameters you call them with make up the interface to a programming library.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Web APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How does this extend to the web?** A Web API is a list of function calls that are made to remote servers. The function call is sent by encoding it as a URL (technically, as an HTTP request -- we'll discuss these later!). The function call typically returns a string of text (e.g. JSON)."

    "APIs are a way developers connect functionality to data, devices, and other resources they provide. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples that APIs can assist with are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Connectivity to a variety of databases\n",
    "- Python modules that can turn LED lights on and off\n",
    "- Application that runs on native Windows, OSX, or Linux\n",
    "- Libraries that post content on Twitter, Facebook, Yelp, or LinkedIn\n",
    "- Web services for accessing currency or stock prices\n",

    "More abstract examples:\n",
    "- Adding your own functions to Numpy itself\n",
    "- Extending Python with C code\n",
    "- Testing Frameworks\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of data science, APIs are a very common method to interact with data hosted by third parties and most commonly provided by **Web Service APIs**, or just **Web APIs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why did APIs become popular?\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs became popular for many reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easy to use for JavaScript programmers\n",
    "- Prevent website scraping\n",
    "- Allow a website's brand to be incorporated into other websites \n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly, in the modern web, nearly every website uses **internal APIs** for shuttling dynamic data between the browser and the website. It is often possible to discover and hijack these internal APIs to gather data. (This is beyond the scope of this lesson.)\n",
    "\n",
    "###Example: Facebook Graph API\n",
    "\n",
    "Facebook provides an API for interacting with their service.  At a glance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- View your posts\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The prevelance of web APIs have increased 10x with the rise of Javascript and advent of web programming techniques. These allow for the transmission of small pieces of data without having to refresh the entire page.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the growth of highly interactive websites powered by modern Javascript, many languages have started co-opting standards to communicate data to and from web servers for two big reasons:\n",
    "- Ease of integration\n",
    "- Consistent standards\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern Javascript allows for **asynchronous requests**, or **AJAX** (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML). This allows websites to send/receive data in the background, e.g. to/from APIs. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Making API calls\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "API calls are really a fancy term for making _HTTP requests_ (in the context of web APIs) to a server and sending/receiving structured data from that endpoint (URL). We are still communicating with URLs, however instead of receiving a string of HTML, we receive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Representational state transfer (REST)](https://spring.io/understanding/REST) is the most common architecture style for passing information to and from these API endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### API Tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "Many APIs are free to access. You first need to register as a developer and obtain an authorization key. In most cases, this is also accompanied by a temporary token that needs to be renewed after some time. This is a way to prevent abuse on the server's resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, the Twitter API requires a token that is used to track how many requests each user makes. Each user can retrieve a limited number of tweets, unless they pay for premium services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start consuming API services, it is important to understand the fundamentals of the underlying communication layer: **HTTP**."

This is like having a driver license which is given by a trusted authority that the requester, such as a police officer, can use as evidence that suggests you are in fact who you say you are.\n",

    "**OAuth (Open Authorization)** is simply a secure authorization protocol that often deals with the authorization of a third-party application to access a user's data without exposing their password (e.g., Login with Facebook, gPlus, Twitter in many websites). \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, before your application can access a user's Facebook data, the user must give your application consent first. As you can imagine, this is a more complex process than before since it involves the user.\n",

    "- Owner (the one with facebook,twitter.. account )\n",

    "There are various levels of OAuth access. For security, some APIs (such as the Yelp API) require OAuth access despite there not being any conventional users. These sites require a less complicated OAuth procedure.\n",

    "### Implementing OAuth in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of OAuth libraries available in Python. If you are using a popular website such as Facebook, it is recommended to use their official Python library to handle the OAuth. If not, it is possible to code your own OAuth procedure. Because OAuth requires back-and-forth with your web application, discussing implementation details is outside of the scope of this lesson.\n",
